# Next.js + Builder.io Starter
A starter based of the [Builder.io + Next.js minimal starter](https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder/tree/main/examples/next-js-simple) with some additional features:
- Custom heading component
- Previewing area for symbols

## Instructions
Replace the public API key with your own in the files: `.env.development` and `.env.production`
### Symbols
To set up symbols, create a section model in your Builder space called **Symbol** and change the preview url to `http://localhost:3000/symbol-preview`
